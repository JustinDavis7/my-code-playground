<h4>
<b>My coding playground</b>
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Just a little project repo for me to put some demo projects that I think of in it.
    </li>
    <li>
        I'm starting off with two small desktop applicaions that I will be following some video tutorials on, so initially there wont be much here to look at.
    </li>
    <li>
        After that, I'm possibly going to be working on a polling application - more on that in file it falls into.
    </li>
<ul>
