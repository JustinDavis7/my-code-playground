# About these programs
## Hello World
&ensp;&ensp;This is going to be a very basic WPF application. I'm going to be following a few different Microsoft tutorials, as well as some video tutorials for other versions of projects like this. The tutorial in question is located at this address: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-wpf?view=vs-2022. It's a very simple, Hello World application to get the ball rolling.

&ensp;&ensp;My reason for starting on this project is actually because of a job application I filed recently. The company wanted me to make a desktop application with Xaml, and I've never worked with this before. So I went and found a few different tutorials, who knows if they are quiality or not, and I will be learning how to use the WPF framework and then expanding to create their desired application to see if I meet their requirements.

## Names
&ensp;&ensp;This second project is still fairly simple, adding names to a name box that a user types in. This is another tutorial from Microsoft available at this address: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/get-started/create-app-visual-studio?view=netdesktop-8.0.

## Record Book
&ensp;&ensp;This is a video tutorial available on YouTube via this link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v8PobcZpqM&ab_channel=TacticDevs. The video starts off with the project already created, and a the view form seemingly created as well, but thanks to the prior two programs, it shouldn't be hard to get up to speed with it. The video creator also has his screen showing the xaml code for the form while giving his intro, so it's easy enough to see what was done and replicate it. This is going to be a record book where you can add new users, and filter through the users via their name.

&ensp;&ensp;This tutorial is using a system that I am all too familiar with, the Model, View, Controller framework or MVC, but is a little different since it has no controller. This is called the MVVM pattern, making use of Models, Views, and ViewModels. I've used all three of those many times before, so this isn't a new concept to me and should prove to be fairly easy to use.
