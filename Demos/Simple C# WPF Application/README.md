# About these programs
## Hello World
&ensp;&ensp;This is going to be a very basic WPF application. I'm going to be following a few different Microsoft tutorials, as well as some video tutorials for other versions of projects like this. The tutorial in question is located at this address: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-wpf?view=vs-2022. It's a very simple, Hello World application to get the ball rolling.

&ensp;&ensp;My reason for starting on this project is actually because of a job application I filed recently. The company wanted me to make a desktop application with Xaml, and I've never worked with this before. So I went and found a few different tutorials, who knows if they are quiality or not, and I will be learning how to use the WPF framework and then expanding to create their desired application to see if I meet their requirements.

## Names
&ensp;&ensp; This second project is still fairly simple, adding names to a name box that a user types in. This is another tutorial from Microsoft available at this address: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/get-started/create-app-visual-studio?view=netdesktop-8.0.
