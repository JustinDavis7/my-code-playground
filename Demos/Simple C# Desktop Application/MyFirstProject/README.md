# First project

## Simple Desktop Application

### Goal:
#### Learning some basics about Windows Forms Apps so that I can start making a GUI interactable style program. I've never done anything outside of a console or web application, and I always wanted to make locally useable programs. The Windows Forms App was the first example of this I found when looking online and I found some good basic tutorials showing how to make them, so that's where this is from.
