# Second Projrect

## Simple Desktop Application

### Goal:
#### Learning a little more about this type of application from a second video tutorial. This video series is 6 years old, but is still useable to teach me what I need --- at least from what I can tell. This application is capable of storing contact information of various people in an Azure DB, and allows the user to add new contacts; search through those contacts; edit; and delete them from the list. Not only has this tutorial series shown me quite a few more items that can be used in these forms, but it has also shown me how to connect to a database for easy storage of info when the need arises. The first video tutorial was very bare bones, and was a good starting point, but this series shows much more behind the scenes code and how to make everything work.

This is a video series consisting of 6 total videos, the first 5 of which I will be using to do the project. The final video is just about how the unique logo was created for the video projects, and I won't be using it myself for a logo since it's not that important to the project at hand. I will still look over it to see how it was done --- could be useful later on perhaps.
